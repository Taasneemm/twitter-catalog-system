# twitter-catalog-system

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

A lightweight Flask-based web application that allows users to register, log in, and catalog tweets based on structured metadata. The app supports both manual and batch tweet uploads using CSV, stores records in a MongoDB database, and visualizes tweet trends over time using Chart.js. Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the frontend and Flask on the backend, the project demonstrates a full-stack approach to social media data management and analysis.
